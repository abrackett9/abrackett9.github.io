                            The Grateful Dead were founded in 1965 by Jerry Garcia (lead guitar, vocals), Bob Weir (rhythm guitar, vocals), Ron "Pigpen" McKernan (keyboards, harmonica, vocals), Phil Lesh (bass, vocals), and Bill Kreutzmann (drums). They were a genre-defying band that blended psychedelic rock, blues, folk, jazz, bluegrass and others. The band struggled to find mainstream success, but they developed a cult-like following because of their legendary live preformances. Many of their followers, dubbed deadheads, would follow their tour around and go to as many as they possibly could. In Their 30 lifespan as a band they released 13 studio albums and 77 live albums. They played their last live show in 1995, a month before Jerry Garcia died.  The Grateful were a very large part of the counter-culture movement in the 60s and 70s; in fact their sound engineer was the largest producer of LSD (an important drug for the counter-culture movement) in the world at the time and is credited to distributing it to other prominent figures of the movement like Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles, and Timothy Leary. The Grateful Dead had, and continue to have, a massive impact on music and soceity.
