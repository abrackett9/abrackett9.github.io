                            Saba, whose real name is Tahj Chandler, is a Chicago-born rapper and producer. Saba's father was a R&B muscisian and got his son involved in music from an early age, bringing him to recording sessions and teaching him the piano. Saba started high school when he was only 12 years old and would hand out his mixtapes in the hallway to try to gain some recongnition. He created the musical group Pivot Gang with his brother and cousin a year after graduating high school at 16 years old. Saba wouldn't gain popularity until he was featured on two songs by fellow Chicago artist, Chance the Rapper in 2013 and 2015. Saba released his first studio album, The Bucket List Project, in early 2016 to moderate comerical success and great critical acclaim. Saba was best friends with his cousin who he founded Pivot Gang with, but sadly his cousin would be stabbed to death at a bus stop for his coat. Saba's cousin's death destroyed him and resulted in him releasing his 2nd studio album in 2018, Care for Me, which has been regarded as one of the most powerful albums in hip hop. Care for Me was dedicated to his late cousin and Saba used as a way to deal with the grief he had from the untimely death. Many critics thought Care for Me was one of the best albums of 2018 and Saba received massive popularity from it. Sadly another member of Pivot Gang was killed in 2021, which added to the grief that Saba was already dealing with. Saba released his 3rd studio album, Few Good Things, in 2022. Saba says that Few Good Things allowed him to explore different musical styles that he felt was more "him", it received great reviews and was well liked by his fans. Saba has had a hard life and he has been able to focus his emotions into his songs.
